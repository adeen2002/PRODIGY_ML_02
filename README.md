I worked on an exciting project focused on customer segmentation using K-means clustering. This task has been a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data.
Clustering in Action: I learned how to implement K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.
Data Preparation: Gained hands-on experience in preprocessing data, which is crucial for achieving meaningful clustering results.
Optimal Clustering: Explored the Elbow Method to determine the right number of clusters, ensuring accuracy and relevance in the segmentation.
Effective Visualization: Enhanced my skills in visualizing data to make the insights clear and actionable.
